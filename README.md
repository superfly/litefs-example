LiteFS Example Application
==========================

This repository is an example of a toy application running on LiteFS. You can
test it out by deploying to Fly.io, or locally with a docker-compose setup.

* [Fly.io instructions](./fly-io-config)
* [Docker-compose instructions](./docker-config)

**Note: commands should be run from the top-level directory for both Fly.io and
local docker-compose (not from the location of the README files above).**
