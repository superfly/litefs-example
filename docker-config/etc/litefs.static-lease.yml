# The lease section defines how LiteFS creates a cluster and
# implements leader election. For dynamic clusters, use the
# "consul". This allows the primary to change automatically when
# the current primary goes down. For a simpler setup, use
# "static" which assigns a single node to be the primary and does
# not failover.
lease:
  # Required. Must be either "consul" or "static".
  type: "static"

  # Required. The URL for this node's LiteFS API.
  # Should match HTTP port.
  advertise-url: "http://primary:20202"

  # Specifies whether the node can become the primary. If using
  # "static" leasing, this should be set to true on the primary
  # and false on the replicas.
